Progressive web apps are websites that look and feel like an app.
This means users can access all information and capabilities without downloading a mobile app.
Instead, progressive web apps use modern web technology to deliver app-like experiences to users, right in their browsers.
They are a great option for businesses that donâ€™t have the budget to invest in a mobile app.

Other benefits include:

Improved performance
Faster loading times
Engaging user experiences
Less data use
