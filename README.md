What Is a Progressive Web App?
Progressive web apps are websites that look and feel like an app. This means users can access all information and capabilities without downloading a mobile app.

Instead, progressive web apps use modern web technology to deliver app-like experiences to users, right in their browsers.

Why Should You Care About Progressive Web Apps?
Progressive web apps successfully help businesses increase conversions, page visits, and session length.

They are a great option for businesses that donâ€™t have the budget to invest in a mobile app.

Other benefits include:

Improved performance
Faster loading times
